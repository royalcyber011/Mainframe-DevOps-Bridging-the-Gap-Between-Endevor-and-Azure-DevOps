# Mainframe-DevOps-Bridging-the-Gap-Between-Endevor-and-Azure-DevOps

Things happen so fast in the digital world; therefore, companies must now rush to update old systems and launch software faster. Mainframes are important for running important business functions, but traditional development tools do not always serve the current DevOps methods well on those systems. One such challenge is integrating Endeavor into Azure DevOps, a crucial step in enabling mainframe DevOps. This bridge is more than a technical feat — it’s a strategic move toward full-scale [Mainframe modernization](https://www.royalcyber.com/technologies/mainframe-modernization/mainframe-modernization-solutions/?refer=T&N&utm_source=offpage&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=mainframe)

This article explores how enterprises can effectively bridge the gap between Endevor and Azure DevOps, streamlining their [SCM mainframe migration](https://www.royalcyber.com/technologies/mainframe-modernization/scm-mainframe-migration/?refer=T&N&utm_source=offpage&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=mainframe) strategy and unleashing the full potential of [modern DevOps](https://www.royalcyber.com/technologies/mainframe-application-support-services/?refer=T&N&utm_source=offpage&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=mainframe) on legacy platforms.

Why Bridging Endevor to Azure DevOps Matters
Because of their unmatched accuracy and dependability, mainframes are trusted by companies in finance, insurance, and healthcare. Moreover, since these systems still rely on Endevor and its kind, agile adoption has become an issue because these tools have not been crafted for it.

Azure DevOps takes a different approach, as it provides all the modern tools for development, agile project management, and flexible CI/CD and is integrated with the Azure cloud. Connecting Endevor to Azure DevOps enables teams to manage mainframe and distribute applications through a unified DevOps pipeline.

It isn’t only about making things simpler for businesses; it also changes how they respond to:

How code is kept safe and made well.
Deployment frequency
Working together between the development and operations teams
A high level of IT continuity and responsiveness over time
Challenges of Traditional Mainframe Development
It’s important to learn about the problems that can occur with Endevor tools before starting the integration process.

Teams working on Mainframes usually work by themselves, unconnected from the DevOps tools used by distributed team members.
Manual processes in Deployments increase the chances of human errors and lower release speed.
No Real-Time Tracking: You cannot follow changes, check program testing, or view the progress of deployments unless you have real-time stakeholder or dashboard software.
A lot of young developers feel confident with Azure DevOps, which tends to leave older tools less used and harder to understand.
These limitations slow innovation and make SCM mainframe migration not just a technological challenge but a business imperative.

Enabling Mainframe DevOps Through Integration

Integrating Endevor to Azure DevOps empowers enterprises to implement mainframe DevOps practices without abandoning the robustness of the mainframe. Because of this, organizations can integrate mainframe applications into DevOps, resulting in faster releases, better agility, and stronger teamwork.

Main Advantages of Integration:

Unify the build, testing, and deployment process for mainframes and distributed systems through a single action.
Collaboration is easier since developers sharing different platforms use the same tools, dashboards, and steps.
Use Git as your one control tool for versioning, which makes it easier to manage how code is updated.
Introduce the mainframe into the same CI/CD processes followed by teams in the cloud and mobile world.
By using the right process, firms can become more flexible as they upgrade their systems one step at a time.
How Royal Cyber Helps to Reduce Challenges

At Royal Cyber, we understand the critical nature of seamless integration when moving from Endevor to Azure DevOps. Our team specializes in enabling mainframe modernization without disrupting ongoing operations. Here’s the process we use:

1. Discovery and Assessment

The first part involves a review of your Endevor system, how you write code, and your software dependencies. Our experts decide which pieces should be migrated, replicated, or included in Azure DevOps.

2. Integration Architecture

Our architects design a tailored integration framework that connects Endevor to Azure DevOps using APIs, webhooks, and automation scripts. We put connectors and middleware in place when needed to make sure information can travel easily between both platforms.

3. Incremental Modernization

Rather than a big-bang approach, we help you execute a phased SCM mainframe migration. It lowers risks, facilitates use, and guarantees your company can continue operating.

4. Automation and CI/CD Pipelines

We create effective CI/CD systems with Azure DevOps, adding in mainframe tests, automating builds, and deploying whenever needed. As a consequence, projects are delivered more quickly, and there is less need for manual handling.

5. Staff Training

Our engagement includes hands-on training to upskill your teams in mainframe DevOps, ensuring long-term success.

Best Practices for Endevor to Azure DevOps Integration

Successfully moving from Endevor to Azure DevOps requires a strategic approach. You should remember these best practices:

1. Start Small, Scale Fast

It is best to begin with a small pilot by integrating only a modest range of applications. After testing, try the method in the entire mainframe environment to see the best results.

2. Leverage Existing APIs

With Endevor and Azure DevOps, you can control and transfer data using their APIs automatically. Rely on these tools to help you avoid the need to build every feature from zero.

3. Use Middleware Solutions

Situations, making use of third-party middleware is more effective. Royal Cyber will choose the proper tools for your specific situation.

4. Maintain Security and Compliance

Evaluate each integration to ensure it respects your enterprise’s security and compliance, especially if you’re serving industries that require more security.

5. Monitor and Optimize

After finishing the integration, closely watch how things are running and used. Use the tools available in Azure DevOps for analytics and logging to fine-tune your pipelines and spot places where work is slowed.

The Future of Mainframe Modernization

It’s no longer a question of deciding to modernize the mainframe but of deciding how to do it. Bridging Endevor to Azure DevOps is one of the most powerful ways to make the mainframe future ready. This approach allows your enterprise to use agile methods, cloudy ways of working, and continuous delivery while maintaining the reliability of the mainframe.

This integration is also foundational for larger Mainframe modernization initiatives, such as migrating workloads to the cloud, implementing containerization, or re-architecting legacy applications.
